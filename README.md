# 🧩 Microservices Assignment Starter Template

This repository is a **starter template** for building a microservices-based system. Use it as a base for your group assignment.

> **Technology-agnostic**: You are free to choose any programming language, framework, or database for each service.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (includes Docker Compose)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- An AI coding tool (recommended): [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/hungdn1701/microservices-assignment-starter.git
cd microservices-assignment-starter

# 2. Initialize the project
bash scripts/init.sh
# Or manually:
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Build and run all services
docker compose up --build

# 4. Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:8080   # Gateway
curl http://localhost:5001   # Service A
curl http://localhost:5002   # Service B
curl http://localhost:3000   # Frontend
```

### Using Make (optional)

```bash
make help      # Show all available commands
make init      # Initialize project
make up        # Build and start all services
make down      # Stop all services
make logs      # View logs
make clean     # Remove everything
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    U[User] --> FE[Frontend :3000]
    FE --> GW[API Gateway :8080]
    GW --> SA[Service A :5001]
    GW --> SB[Service B :5002]
    SA --> DB1[(Database A)]
    SB --> DB2[(Database B)]
```

- **Frontend** → User interface, communicates only with the Gateway
- **Gateway** → Routes requests to appropriate backend services
- **Services** → Independent microservices, each with their own database
- **Communication** → REST APIs over Docker Compose network

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development (Vibe Coding)

This repo is pre-configured for **AI-powered development**. Each AI tool auto-loads its instruction file:

| Tool | Config File |
|------|-------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |

All instruction files point to [`.ai/AGENTS.md`](.ai/AGENTS.md) as the single source of truth.
Ready-to-use prompt templates are in [`.ai/prompts/`](.ai/prompts/).

## 📋 Recommended Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis & Design
- [ ] Read and understand this starter template
- [ ] Choose your business domain and use case
- [ ] Document analysis in [`docs/analysis-and-design.md`](docs/analysis-and-design.md)
- [ ] Design system architecture in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)

### Phase 2: API Design
- [ ] Define APIs using OpenAPI 3.0 in [`docs/api-specs/`](docs/api-specs/)
- [ ] Include all endpoints, request/response schemas
- [ ] Review API design with the team

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Choose tech stack for each service (can be different per service!)
- [ ] Update Dockerfiles for each service
- [ ] Implement `GET /health` endpoint in every service
- [ ] Implement business logic and API endpoints
- [ ] Configure API Gateway routing
- [ ] Build frontend UI

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Verify `docker compose up --build` starts everything
- [ ] Update service `readme.md` files
- [ ] Update this `README.md` with your project details

---

## 🧪 Development Guidelines

- **Health checks**: Every service MUST expose `GET /health` → `{"status": "ok"}`
- **Environment**: Use `.env` for configuration, never hardcode secrets
- **Networking**: Services communicate via Docker Compose DNS (use service names, not `localhost`)
- **API specs**: Keep OpenAPI specs in sync with implementation
- **Git workflow**: Use branches, write meaningful commit messages, commit often

---

## 👩‍🏫 Assignment Submission Checklist

- [ ] `README.md` updated with team info, service descriptions, and usage instructions
- [ ] All services start with `docker compose up --build`
- [ ] Every service has a working `GET /health` endpoint
- [ ] API documentation complete in `docs/api-specs/`
- [ ] Architecture documented in `docs/architecture.md`
- [ ] Analysis and design documented in `docs/analysis-and-design.md`
- [ ] Each service has its own `readme.md`
- [ ] Code is clean, organized, and follows chosen language conventions
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
