# Getting Started — Starter Template Guide

> This file explains **how to use this starter template**. It is not part of your project deliverable.
> After completing setup, your project documentation lives in [`README.md`](README.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (includes Docker Compose)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- An AI coding tool (recommended): [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fork this repository on GitHub
#    Go to https://github.com/hungdn1701/microservices-assignment-starter
#    Click "Fork" → create fork under your account or team organization

# 2. Clone YOUR fork (not the original)
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/microservices-assignment-starter.git
cd microservices-assignment-starter

# 2. Initialize the project
bash scripts/init.sh
# Or manually:
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Build and run all services
docker compose up --build

# 4. Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:8080   # Gateway
curl http://localhost:5001   # Service A
curl http://localhost:5002   # Service B
curl http://localhost:3000   # Frontend
```

### Using Make (optional)

```bash
make help      # Show all available commands
make init      # Initialize project
make up        # Build and start all services
make down      # Stop all services
make logs      # View logs
make clean     # Remove everything
```

## Recommended Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis & Design
- [ ] Read and understand this starter template
- [ ] Choose your business domain and use case
- [ ] Choose **one** analysis approach and complete it:
  - **Approach 1 — SOA (Erl)**: [`docs/analysis-and-design.md`](docs/analysis-and-design.md) — step-by-step process decomposition
  - **Approach 2 — Strategic DDD**: [`docs/analysis-and-design-ddd.md`](docs/analysis-and-design-ddd.md) — domain events and bounded contexts

### Phase 2: Architecture & API Design
- [ ] Select patterns and complete [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)
- [ ] Define APIs in [`docs/api-specs/`](docs/api-specs/)

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Choose tech stack for each service
- [ ] Update Dockerfiles
- [ ] Implement `GET /health` in every service
- [ ] Implement business logic and API endpoints
- [ ] Configure Gateway routing
- [ ] Build frontend

### Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization
- [ ] Verify `docker compose up --build` works end-to-end
- [ ] Update [`README.md`](README.md) with your project details
- [ ] Update each service's `readme.md`

---

## Submission Checklist

> Use this checklist before submitting your assignment.

- [ ] `README.md` updated with team info and service descriptions
- [ ] All services start with `docker compose up --build`
- [ ] Every service has a working `GET /health` endpoint
- [ ] [`docs/analysis-and-design.md`](docs/analysis-and-design.md) completed
- [ ] [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) completed
- [ ] OpenAPI specs in `docs/api-specs/` match implementation
- [ ] Each service has its own `readme.md`
- [ ] Code is clean, organized, and follows chosen language conventions

## AI-Assisted Development (Vibe Coding)

This repo is pre-configured for AI-powered development:

| Tool | Config File |
|------|-------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |

All config files point to [`.ai/AGENTS.md`](.ai/AGENTS.md) as the single source of truth.
Prompt templates: [`.ai/prompts/`](.ai/prompts/).

> Full guide: [`.ai/vibe-coding-guide.md`](.ai/vibe-coding-guide.md)

---

## Git Workflow

```
main
 └── feature/service-a-endpoints    ← each member works on a feature branch
 └── feature/gateway-routing
 └── feature/frontend-ui
```

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/<description>`
2. Commit often with meaningful messages
3. Push and open a Pull Request to `main`
4. Review as a team, then merge

---

## Development Guidelines

- **Health checks**: Every service MUST expose `GET /health` → `{"status": "ok"}`
- **Environment**: Use `.env` for configuration, never hardcode secrets
- **Networking**: Services communicate via Docker Compose DNS (use service names, not `localhost`)
- **API specs**: Keep OpenAPI specs in sync with implementation
- **Git**: Use branches, meaningful commit messages, commit often
